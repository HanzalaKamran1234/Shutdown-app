# 🔌 Shutdown App (Tkinter Project)

This is a simple **Shutdown App** built with **Python Tkinter** that allows users to perform basic system power operations (Restart, Timed Restart, Log Out, and Shutdown) with a graphical user interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Restart** → Immediately restarts your computer.  
- **Restart with Timer** → Restarts your computer after 20 seconds.  
- **Log Out** → Logs the current user out of the system.  
- **Shutdown** → Shuts down your computer.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **os module** (to execute system commands)

## 📂 Project Structure
Shutdown-App/
- **│── shutdown_app.py # Main Python script**
- **│── README.md # Project documentation**


---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
2. Save the script as `shutdown_app.py`.  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python shutdown_app.py

A GUI window will appear with four buttons:
Restart
Restart Time
Log Out
Shut Down
⚠️ Note: This project is designed for Windows OS, since it uses shutdown commands specific to Windows.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project directly executes system shutdown/restart/logout commands.
Use it carefully, as it will affect your computer immediately.
Do you want me to also include a **badge-style header** (like Python version, OS, GUI) at the top of the README so it looks more professional?
